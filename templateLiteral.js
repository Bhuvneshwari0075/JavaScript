//use of template literal in js


// String Interpolation

let num1=9
let num2=10
let result=num1+num2

//console.log("The addition of "+num1+","+num2+" is:"+result)

console.log(`The addition of ${num1} and ${num2} is ${result}`)

//use back ticks instead of double quotes to define a string

//u can have single and double quotes inside your string  
console.log(`My name is" Nelesh' Welcome `)

//one more use of back tick: if you want to print anything on newline without using newline character \n

console.log( `Welcome kjnvlkdj
 home
 xdfvdsf
 dfds
 `)   //it writes on newline
