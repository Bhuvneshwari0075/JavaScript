//While loop in javascript
//we use while loop if we want to repeat few statements

console.log("hi")
console.log("hi")
console.log("hi")
console.log("hi")
console.log("hi")

//DRY- Don't repeat yourself

let i=10  //initialization of a counter
while(i<=10) //condition on counter

{ 
    console.log("hi");
    i++;   // increment or decrement //it also works as a assignment operator
}

console.log(i)

//Do-While Loop in javascript

//if you want to execute the statements alteast once and then check the condition

let a=1
do{
    console.log("hello");
    a++;

}while(a<=5)
